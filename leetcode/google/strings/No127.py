# Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation
# sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
#
# Only one letter can be changed at a time.
# Each transformed word must exist in the word list.
# Note:
#
# Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
# All words have the same length.
# All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
# You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
# You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.
